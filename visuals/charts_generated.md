## Generated Charts and Interpretation

### Refugee Inflows (2019–2023)

The plot above shows a sudden increase in refugee arrivals in 2022 following the Ukraine war outbreak. According to the UNHCR and Deloitte report, refugees contributed an estimated 2.7% to Poland’s GDP in 2024 due to high labor market participation, without drastically increasing unemployment or lowering wages.

### GDP Growth in Poland

Despite the shock of the war and inflationary pressure, Poland maintained positive GDP growth rates in 2022 and 2023. This suggests that the economy was resilient and that refugee inflows may have mitigated labor shortages, supporting continued economic activity.

### Inflation Trend

Inflation spiked after 2022, but research indicates that this was largely due to global energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions rather than migration effects per se. This contextual information helps separate inflation causes from refugee inflows. 

### Correlation Between Refugees and GDP Growth

This chart illustrates the relationship between the number of Ukrainian refugees 
in Poland and the country's GDP growth over the years 2019–2023. 

Observations:
- A positive correlation suggests that the refugee inflow did not negatively affect GDP growth.
- The trend indicates that the Polish economy was able to absorb the additional population 
  and maintain economic growth.
### Employment Rate Trends in Poland

This line chart shows the evolution of total, male, and female employment rates in Poland. 
The red dashed line marks 2022, the year of the large Ukrainian refugee influx.

Observations:
- Employment rates increased gradually from 2019 to 2023, without significant decline after 2022.
- Male and female employment trends follow a similar upward pattern.
- This suggests that the Polish labor market continued to absorb labor despite the influx of refugees.

This line chart shows the unemployment rate over the period 2019–2023. 
The red dashed line indicates 2022, highlighting the start of the refugee inflow.

Observations:
