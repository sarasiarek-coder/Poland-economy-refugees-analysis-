## Generated Charts and Interpretation

### Refugee Inflows (2019–2023)

The plot above shows a sudden increase in refugee arrivals in 2022 following the Ukraine war outbreak. According to the UNHCR and Deloitte report, refugees contributed an estimated 2.7% to Poland’s GDP in 2024 due to high labor market participation, without drastically increasing unemployment or lowering wages.

### GDP Growth in Poland

Despite the shock of the war and inflationary pressure, Poland maintained positive GDP growth rates in 2022 and 2023. This suggests that the economy was resilient and that refugee inflows may have mitigated labor shortages, supporting continued economic activity.

### Inflation Trend

Inflation spiked after 2022, but research indicates that this was largely due to global energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions rather than migration effects per se. This contextual information helps separate inflation causes from refugee inflows.
