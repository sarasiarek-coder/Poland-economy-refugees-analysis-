# Conclusion

This project gives an overview of how Poland’s economy evolved after the Ukraine war and the arrival of Ukrainian refugees. The data show that GDP growth, labor market participation, and inflation all changed noticeably during this period.  
Recent research also suggests that Ukrainian refugees contributed positively to the Polish economy, making up an estimated 2.7% of GDP in 2024 and integrating quickly into the labor market without causing clear negative effects on unemployment or wages.  
From this analysis and the external evidence, it seems that when refugees are supported in finding jobs, their presence can bring real economic benefits. This project suggests that demographic inflows, combined with open labor market policies, can have measurable effects on the economy.  
Of course, more research would be needed to understand causality, but the patterns we see in the data line up with broader reports and findings. Overall, the project shows how careful data analysis can help connect real numbers with practical economic insights.
