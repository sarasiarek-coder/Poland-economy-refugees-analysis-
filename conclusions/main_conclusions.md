# Conclusion

This analysis provides a structured overview of Poland’s macroeconomic trajectory following the Ukraine war and the associated refugee inflows. The data show that key indicators such as GDP growth, labor market participation, and inflation underwent notable changes during the period under study.
Importantly, recent institutional research indicates that Ukrainian refugees contributed positively to the Polish economy, accounting for an estimated 2.7 % of GDP in 2024 and integrating rapidly into the labor market without triggering adverse effects on unemployment or wages.
The evidence from the analysis and external reports highlights the potential economic benefits of refugee integration when supported by policy measures that enable labor market access and participation.
Given these patterns, this project supports the view that demographic inflows — when paired with open labor market policies — can be associated with measurable macroeconomic dynamics. Further research would be needed to establish causal relationships, but the descriptive trends documented here align with broader institutional findings.
Overall, this work demonstrates a disciplined approach to economic data analysis and clear linkages between empirical data and policy-relevant interpretation.
