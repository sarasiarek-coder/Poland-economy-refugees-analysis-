## Economic Interpretation

The Ukrainian war generated a major supply and humanitarian shock.

Despite a surge in inflation, Poland maintained positive GDP growth in 2022.
Refugee inflows may have helped mitigate labor shortages, especially in low- and medium-skilled sectors.

Inflation dynamics appear more related to energy and supply-chain shocks than to migration flows.
