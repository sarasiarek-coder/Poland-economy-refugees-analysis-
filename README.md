# Economic Impact of Ukrainian Refugees on Poland’s Economy

This project investigates the economic effects of the inflow of Ukrainian refugees on Poland’s economy following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Using publicly available data and economic indicators, this analysis explores how refugee inflows influenced GDP, labor market outcomes, employment rates, and fiscal contributions in Poland.  
The analysis combines data processing, visual exploration, and interpretation of findings in an economic context.

## Methodology

This analysis includes:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Standardization of economic and labour market time series  
   - Handling of missing values and normalization  

2. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Time trends for GDP and employment indicators  
   - Cross-series visualization of refugee inflows versus economic outcomes  

3. **Comparative Insights**  
   - Comparisons between 2023 and 2024 trends  
   - Contextual interpretation relative to published studies  

4. **Economic Interpretation**  
   - Assessment of how integration policies, labor participation, and consumption contributed to growth  
     
## Key Findings

- **GDP Contribution:** Refugees contributed significantly to Poland's GDP, with estimates around 2.7% in 2024.  
- **Labor Market Integration:** Employment among refugees increased from 61% in 2022 to ~69% in 2023, approaching native employment rates.  
- **Productivity & Consumption:** Refugees contributed both as labor supply and as consumers, stimulating domestic demand.  
- **Policy Implications:** Early labor market access and recognition of qualifications enhance productivity and economic impact.

## Interpretation & Policy Context

The analysis shows that refugees can have a positive net economic impact when integration into labor markets is supported. Implications for policymakers include:  
- Promote early labor market entry for refugees  
- Reduce barriers related to language and qualification recognition  
- Support programs that enhance productivity and consumption contribution
