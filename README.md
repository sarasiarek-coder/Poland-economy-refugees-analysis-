# Economic Impact of Ukrainian Refugees on Poland’s Economy

This project looks at how Poland’s main macroeconomic indicators evolved after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022 and the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian refugees.  
The goal is not to prove causality, but to explore whether there are visible patterns between refugee inflows and changes in GDP growth, inflation and labor market indicators. The analysis is based on publicly available data and focuses on descriptive statistics and visual interpretation.

## Research Question
How did Poland’s economy change after 2022?  
Did GDP growth show noticeable differences compared to previous years?  
Were inflation and unemployment affected during the same period?  
Is there any observable relationship between refugee inflows and macroeconomic trends?  
  
## Data Sources  
The data used in this analysis comes from:  
World Bank  
Eurostat  
Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS)  
UNHCR refugee statistics    

## Methodology

The analysis follows a standard workflow:
Collection of macroeconomic and refugee data  
Cleaning and preparation of datasets  
Basic descriptive statistics  
Time-series visualization  
Interpretation of trends   
     
## Key Findings

After 2022, Poland experienced significant macroeconomic adjustments. Inflation increased sharply, while GDP growth showed fluctuations compared to previous years.
At the same time, refugee inflows reached historically high levels. The data suggest that the Polish labor market absorbed a substantial part of the new population without a visible increase in unemployment rates.  
Although multiple external factors were affecting the economy (energy prices, global inflation, post-pandemic adjustments), the descriptive evidence indicates that refugee integration did not produce negative macroeconomic distortions in the short term.

## Interpretation

The findings are consistent with the idea that labor market integration plays a central role in determining the economic impact of migration. When access to employment is relatively fast, demographic inflows can contribute to production and consumption rather than increasing fiscal pressure.  
However, this analysis remains descriptive. A more rigorous causal study would require additional modeling and counterfactual estimation.
