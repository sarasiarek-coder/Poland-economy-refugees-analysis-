# Economic Impact of Ukrainian Refugees on Poland’s Economy

This project looks at how Poland’s main macroeconomic indicators evolved after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022 and the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian refugees.  
The goal is to see whether there are visible patterns between refugee inflows and changes in GDP growth, inflation and labor market indicators.

## Research Question
How did Poland’s economy change after 2022?  
Did GDP growth show noticeable differences compared to previous years?  
Were inflation and unemployment affected during the same period?  
Is there any observable relationship between refugee inflows and macroeconomic trends?  
  
## Data Sources  
The data used in this analysis comes from:  
World Bank  
Eurostat  
Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS)  
UNHCR refugee statistics    

## Methodology

The analysis follows a standard workflow:
Collection of macroeconomic and refugee data  
Cleaning and preparation of datasets  
Basic descriptive statistics  
Time-series visualization  
Interpretation of trends   
     
## Key Findings

After 2022, Poland experienced noticeable economic changes. Inflation went up quickly, reaching levels higher than in previous years, and GDP growth became less stable than before the war.  
At the same time, a large number of Ukrainian refugees arrived in the country. From the data, it seems that the labor market was able to absorb a good portion of this new population, and unemployment did not show a clear increase linked to the inflow.  
Of course, many other factors were also at play, such as rising energy prices, global inflation, and the lingering effects of the pandemic. So it would be too simple to blame any single factor. Still, the descriptive data suggest that refugee integration did not cause immediate economic instability.

## Interpretation

Overall, the results suggest that how quickly refugees enter the labor market matters a lot for their economic impact. When people are able to find jobs relatively soon, they can contribute to production and consumption instead of becoming an additional fiscal burden.  
That said, this project is based on descriptive analysis. To draw stronger conclusions about causality, more advanced methods and a more detailed econometric approach would be necessary.
