# Economic Impact of Ukrainian Refugees on Poland’s Economy

This project analyzes the evolution of key Polish macroeconomic indicators following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent inflow of Ukrainian refugees into Poland.
The objective is to explore whether and how refugee inflows are associated with changes in GDP growth, inflation, and labor market dynamics.
The analysis is conducted using publicly available macroeconomic data and refugee statistics, with a focus on descriptive analysis and data visualization.

## Research Question
How did key economic indicators in Poland change after the outbreak of the Ukraine war and the arrival of Ukrainian refugees?  
How did Poland’s GDP evolve after 2022?  
Is there a visible relationship between refugee inflows and economic growth?  
Did inflation or labor market indicators show structural changes during the same period?  
What preliminary insights can be derived from the observed data trends?  
  
## Data Sources  
The analysis is based on publicly available data from:  
World Bank  
Eurostat  
Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS)  
UNHCR refugee statistics    

## Methodology

The project follows a structured data analysis workflow:  
-Data collection from official macroeconomic databases  
-Data cleaning and preprocessing  
-Descriptive statistical analysis  
-Time-series visualization  
-Interpretation of trends and economic implications    
     
## Key Findings

-Poland experienced strong macroeconomic adjustments after 2022, with visible shifts in inflation and GDP growth dynamics.  
-Refugee inflows coincided with significant economic changes, particularly in labor market participation.  
-The data suggest that refugee integration may have had measurable economic relevance, although external macroeconomic shocks must also be considered.  

## Interpretation & Policy Context

The analysis shows that refugees can have a positive net economic impact when integration into labor markets is supported. Implications for policymakers include:  
- Promote early labor market entry for refugees  
- Reduce barriers related to language and qualification recognition  
- Support programs that enhance productivity and consumption contribution
