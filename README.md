# Economic Impact of Ukrainian Refugees on Poland’s Economy

This project investigates the economic effects of the inflow of Ukrainian refugees on Poland’s economy following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Using publicly available data and economic indicators, this analysis explores how refugee inflows influenced GDP, labor market outcomes, employment rates, and fiscal contributions in Poland.  
The analysis combines data processing, visual exploration, and interpretation of findings in an economic context.
