## Public Finance and Fiscal Sustainability

Refugee inflows required significant public spending, mainly financed through:
- National budget reallocations
- EU financial support

Despite higher expenditures, Poland maintained fiscal sustainability due to:
- Strong pre-crisis growth
- Increased tax revenues from employed refugees

The net fiscal impact is estimated to become positive in the long run.
