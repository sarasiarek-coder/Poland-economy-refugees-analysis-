## Labor Market Effects

The Polish labor market prior to 2022 was characterized by labor shortages and low unemployment.

Refugees, especially from Ukraine, helped:
- Fill low- and medium-skilled job positions
- Reduce bottlenecks in manufacturing, services, and construction
- Stabilize wage pressures in certain sectors

Overall, refugee integration mitigated labor market rigidities rather than increasing unemployment.
