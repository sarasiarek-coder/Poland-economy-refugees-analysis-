## Economic Impact of Refugees in Poland

The arrival of refugees has both short-term and long-term economic effects.

In the short run, public expenditure increases due to housing, healthcare, and social assistance.
However, aggregate demand also rises, partially offsetting fiscal costs.

In the medium-to-long term, refugees contribute positively to GDP through:
- Increased labor supply
- Higher consumption
- Human capital accumulation

Empirical evidence suggests that the Polish economy has absorbed refugees without significant negative effects on growth.
